This project is a collection of physics animations. I made these with p5 JS, HTML, and CSS. I did use GitHub Copilot for this project, but only for coding templates. The rest of the code is my utilization of the knowledge I gained in my physics class with programming.
I do not wish to profit off these animations, only to build basic physics intution for those who find the subject intangible (initially me), which is why I've only given these animations the MIT License. I find it reasonable to be given credit for the work I put into these projects, but the goal of these projects was to promote a willingness to learn physics, so I encourage you to take the code and mess around with it a bit. I only humbly request that I be given credit for the original code.
If you stumble across anything cool with the code that was not present in the original code or have made similar coding projects open an issue in the repo and notify of your new project and I will try an implement it in this project and give you credit for it.
